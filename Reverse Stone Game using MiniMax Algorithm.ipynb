    "The static evaluation function is designed based on the parity (odd or even) of the total number of stones remaining. While not a perfect strategy, this heuristic provides a simple and effective way for the AI to make logical decisions. The core idea is that controlling the parity can guide the game toward a favorable end-state.\n",
